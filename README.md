Our repository for JunctionX Budapest challenge. Wrote some code in one day that has pretty much the algorithm and how it should work. It has some bugs as well but this is how much we managed to do today. I worked on the development of the program part with my colleague, Mihai.

Technical Instructions :
 - Open Android Studio (or install it firstly if you do not have it)
 - Clone the repository in an empty folder on your computer
 - Open the project in Android Studio
 - You can analyse the algorithm behind (there are some bugs) 
 - To test the first two pages that work (how the app should work) you have to :
 -      Have an Android phone
 -      Connect the phone with an USB in your laptop
 -      How to run on your phone : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zaa4aIm-yM&ab_channel=ForMyScholars
 - Test the app and play with its functionalities (it might look weird, but hey, it...kinda works :D )
 - You're done !
